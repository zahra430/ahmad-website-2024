              <strong>T</strong>he syntax of spaces is one of the significant
              factors affecting visitors' sense of security in urban parks. Due
              to the vitality and green nature of parks, they are expected to
              provide more sense of peace and security to visitors than other
              urban spaces; However, Tappeh-Bashi Park in the city of Naghadeh,
              located in West Azarbaijan province, Iran, is a counterexample.
              This park, despite its glory days not so far past, has become a
              place for addicts and criminals because of a lack of surveillance,
              ethnic conflicts, and the stoning of two people there. Recently,
              measures have been taken by the municipality to improve the
              security of the park, such as taking out criminals, implementing
              some sports facilities, and planting trees, and flowers. Although
              this has reduced the rate of crime significantly, citizens still
              do not desire to visit this park due to their sense of fear of
              possible crimes. The root of this issue is both subjective and
              objective and this study's focus is on the objective aspect. The
              purpose is to find the areas inducing a sense of fear of crime in
              visitors in the case study by assessing the role of the objective
              factors related to the spatial syntax of the park in both physical
              and visual dimensions. To do so, the qualities affecting the sense
              of fear in visitors of Tappeh-Bashi Park and their extracted
              indicators were evaluated by space syntax technique and through
              Depthmap software. In this research, the four qualities of
              accessibility, choice, controllability, and integration in the
              physical dimension, and the qualities of lighting, visibility, and
              attraction in the visual dimension were evaluated. First of all,
              the base map of the site was updated, and the axial maps of
              indicators including connectivity, mean depth, metric depth,
              permeability, and mysteriousness were prepared in DepthMap
              Software and valued in Geographic Information System (GIS). Next,
              the obtained quality maps were weighed and overlaid to get the
              final axial map. Then, the visual graph of the clustering
              coefficient indicator was combined with the final map, which gave
              us three areas inducing a sense of fear among visitors. Finally,
              three areas were also examined in terms of visibility indicators
              such as maximum radial line, compactness, and occlusivity, which
              gave us a good insight to analyse the potentials of each area for
              reducing sense of fear. For findings validation, the agent
              analysis of the site was applied, which proved area two has the
              potential for designing against the sense of fear of crime with
              the aim of enhancing social interaction. The site also was
              assessed according to the intensity of lighting at night showing
              that area three lacks proper lighting. The results showed that the
              dead-end and undefined routes in the park have reduced the
              mobility and integrity of pedestrian paths. Moreover, spaces with
              low levels of lighting at night, spaces that lack natural
              surveillance, and mysterious and abandoned spaces in the park have
              the highest potential to induce feelings of insecurity and a sense
              of fear of crime.

              <strong>C</strong>rime increasing and its consequences is one of
              the obvious manifestations of urbanization development. The
              inefficiency of urban spaces such as inefficient urban furniture
              and disregard for its practical and aesthetic values has been
              recognized as one of the most influential factors in crime in
              cities. Lack of context-based design, ignoring the needs of
              residents, and mere copying of modern equipment, has emptied the
              furniture of today's cities from aesthetic and functional values
              to inefficient elements and visual and even environmental
              pollutants. This leads to abandonment of urban spaces and non-use
              of equipment, and there is no doubt that there is a high
              correlation between the absence of humans as observer eyes in
              urban space and the increase in crime and sabotage in these
              spaces. The purpose of this study is to provide an urban furniture
              design framework to help urban furniture design` to prevent crime
              and improve quality of life. The method of this research is based
              on a descriptive aspect rather than an exploratory one and
              introduces the necessary principles, features, and considerations
              in the field of anti-crime urban furniture. The data used for
              explanation have been obtained from collecting, describing, and
              organizing documentary and library resources in the form of
              subject research. To maintain the effectiveness of urban spaces,
              the physical and psychological aspects must be compatible between
              the qualitative elements and the social and cultural
              characteristics of the citizens. Psychologically, increasing
              traffic and lighting in environments with high crime rates and
              designing happy environments can prevent crime and reduce fear of
              crime. It is noted that the use of urban furniture as one of the
              tools of environmental design in crime prevention is considered, a
              design guide in five dimensions including practical criteria about
              the design of urban furniture with a crime prevention approach is
              presented. <br />
